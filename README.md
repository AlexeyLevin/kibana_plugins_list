It isn't always easy to find Kibana plugins, so I wanted to make a list of all of the plugins that I am aware of.

NOTE: Not all plugins will work with all versions of Kibana. The Kibana plugin interfaces are in a state of constant development. Plugin developers should release a new version of their plugin for each new Kibana release as a result.
